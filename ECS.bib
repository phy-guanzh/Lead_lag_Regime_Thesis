abstract = {This paper examines the lead–lag relationship between the FTSE 100 index and index futures price employing a number of time series models. Using 10-min observations from June 1996–1997, it is found that lagged changes in the futures price can help to predict changes in the spot price. The best forecasting model is of the error correction type, allowing for the theoretical difference between spot and futures prices according to the cost of carry relationship. This predictive ability is in turn utilised to derive a trading strategy which is tested under real-world conditions to search for systematic profitable trading opportunities. It is revealed that although the model forecasts produce significantly higher returns than a passive benchmark, the model was unable to outperform the benchmark after allowing for transaction costs.}

abstract = {We study long-range magnitude cross-correlations in collective modes of real-world data from finance, physiology, and genomics using time-lag random matrix theory. We find long-range magnitude cross-correlations i) in time series of price fluctuations, ii) in physiological time series, both healthy and pathological, indicating scale-invariant interactions between different physiological time series, and iii) in ChIP-seq data of the mouse genome, where we uncover a complex interplay of different DNA-binding proteins, resulting in power-law cross-correlations in xij, the probability that protein i binds to gene j, ranging up to 10 million base pairs. In finance, we find that the changes in singular vectors and singular values are largest in times of crisis. We find that the largest 500 singular values of the NYSE Composite members follow a Zipf distribution with exponent ≈2. In physiology, we find statistically significant differences between alcoholic and control subjects.}

abstract={ To our knowledge, this paper is the first study on the effect of information arrival on the lead-lag relationship amongst related spot instruments. Based on a large data-set of ultra-high-frequency transaction prices time-stamped to the millisecond of the S\&P500 index and its two most liquid tracking ETFs, we find that their -lag relationship is affected by the rate of information arrival whose proxy is the unexpected trading volume of these instruments. Specifically, when information arrives, the leadership of the leading instrument may strengthen or weaken depending on whether the leading or lagging instrument responds to that information. An increase in the unexpected volume of the leader strengthens its leadership whereas an increase in the unexpected volume of the lagger weakens this leadership. In addition to the strength of leadership, an increase in the unexpected volume in response to information arrival may also have opposite effects on the lead-lag correlation coefficient depending on whether that volume increase belongs to the leader or the lagger. Finally, we find that sophisticated investors have a more significant effect on the -lag relationship than non-sophisticated ones.},

abstract={Human activities widely exhibit a power-law distribution. Considering stock trading as a typical human activity in the financial domain, the first aim of this paper is to validate whether the well-known power-law distribution can be observed in this activity. Interestingly, this paper determines that the number of accumulated lead--lag days between stock pairs meets the power-law distribution in both the U.S. and Chinese stock markets based on 10 years of trading data. Based on this finding this paper adopts the power-law distribution to formally define the lead--lag effect, detect stock pairs with the lead--lag effect, and then design a pure lead--lag investment strategy as well as enhancement investment strategies by integrating the lead--lag strategy into classic alpha-factor strategies. Tests conducted on 20 different alpha-factor strategies demonstrate that both perform better than the selected benchmark strategy and that the lead--lag strategy provides useful signals that significantly improve the performance of basic alpha-factor strategies. Our results therefore indicate that the lead--lag effect may provide effective information for designing more profitable investment strategies.},

abstract = {Financial markets are prominent examples for highly non-stationary systems. Sample averaged observables such as variances and correlation coefficients strongly depend on the time window in which they are evaluated. This implies severe limitations for approaches in the spirit of standard equilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. Nevertheless, we show that there are similar generic features which we uncover in the empirical multivariate return distributions for whole markets. We explain our findings by setting up a random matrix model.}

This article solves the dynamic portfolio choice problem of a U.S. investor faced with a time-varying investment opportunity set modeled using a regime-switching process which may be characterized by correlations and volatilities that increase in bad times. International diversification is still valuable with regime changes and currency hedging imparts further benefit. The costs of ignoring the regimes are small for all-equity portfolios but increase when a conditionally risk-free asset can be held.},

abstract = {We document significant “time series momentum” in equity index, currency, commodity, and bond futures for each of the 58 liquid instruments we consider. We find persistence in returns for one to 12 months that partially reverses over longer horizons, consistent with sentiment theories of initial under-reaction and delayed over-reaction. A diversified portfolio of time series momentum strategies across all asset classes delivers substantial abnormal returns with little exposure to standard asset pricing factors and performs best during extreme markets. Examining the trading activities of speculators and hedgers, we find that speculators profit from time series momentum at the expense of hedgers.}

One explanation is that extremely large shocks, such as the October 1987 crash, arise from quite different causes and have different consequences for subsequent volatility than do small shocks. We explore this possibility with U.S. weekly stock returns, allowing the parameters of an ARCH process to come from one of several different regimes, with transitions between regimes governed by an unobserved Markov chain. We estimate models with two to four regimes in which the latent innovations come from Gaussian and Student t distributions.}

abstract = {This paper aims to provide a systematic approach to the treatment of differential equations of the typedyt = Σi fi(yt) dxti where the driving signal xt is a rough path. Such equations are very common and occur particularly frequently in probability where the driving signal might be a vector valued Brownian motion, semi-martingale or similar process.However, our approach is deterministic, is totally independent of probability and permits much rougher paths than the Brownian paths usually discussed. The results here are strong enough to treat the main probabilistic examples and significantly widen the class of stochastic processes which can be used to drive stochastic differential equations. (For a simple example see [10], [1]).We hope our results will have an influence on infinite dimensional analysis on path spaces, loop groups, etc. as well as in more applied situations. Variable step size algorithms for the numerical integration of stochastic differential equations [8] have been constructed as a consequence of these results.},
